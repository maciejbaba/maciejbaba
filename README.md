### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Maciek (pronounce  Ma-ts-e-ek) I adore programming and I can't imagine day without writing at least one line of code, view programming-related content or typing some sort of command.

## Main focus on Frontend Development, later I will try my best in Backend.

- In general, I enjoy everything that is related to computers or other machines.
- I also like old "trash" cars like seicento, polonez, golf 3, and so forth. I enjoy walks, reading books, physics, maths, electronics, psychology. I know nice combination :)
- I don't drink or smoke, I totally hate radio and ads

- I know JS, TS, HTML, CSS, Python, SQL, Linux, Windows, Git

- For now Firefox DE, Fedora, VS code
- 
- Learning React, Tailwind, Git, CI/CD, T3 stack, Express
