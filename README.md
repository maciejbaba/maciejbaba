## 🚗 Automotive Interests
I have a soft spot for what some might call "trash" cars such as:

- Fiat Seicento
- Polonez
- Volkswagen Golf 3
- Audi 80

Why? They're cheap, robust, and delightfully simple to repair.

## 🛠️ DIY Philosophy
Whether it's coding, electronics or cars, I believe in getting my hands dirty. There's no problem that can't be solved with a bit of ingenuity and elbow grease.
