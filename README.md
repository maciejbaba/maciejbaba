### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Maciej (pronounce  Ma-che-y) I adore programming and I can't imagine a day without writing at least one line of code, viewing programming-related content, reading about new stuff or typing some sort of command. I also read about old stuff and how the whole IT world works (it's so interesting, under all of it is math) i.e. video transfer and JPEG (DCT algorithm)

## Focusing on Full Stack Development

#### I'm familiar with JS, TS, HTML, CSS, SQL, Linux, Windows, Git, React, Tailwind

#### For now Firefox DE, Chrome, Fedora/Ubuntu/Windows, VS code

#### Learning TS, MERN, RTK, Tailwind, Git, CI/CD, REST API, Algorithms, Unit Testing

#### Planning to learn Docker, Webpack, DDD, TDD, OOP, T3 Stack, Next.js, C or C++, C# or Java (one typical backend OOP language)

In general, I am interested in everything that is related to computers or other machines but I find programming the most interesting, one of the reasons is high level of brain activity during doing it.

I like old "trash" cars like seicento, polonez, golf 3, audi 80 and so forth (they are cheap and robust - there is no need to care about them).
