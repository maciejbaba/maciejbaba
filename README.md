- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Maciek (pronounce  Ma-ts-e-ek) I enjoy programming and I can't imagine day without writing at least one line of code, watching something about code or typing some kind of command.
- I like in general everything that is related to computers / machines.
- I also like old "trash" cars like seicento, polonez, golf 3 etc. I enjoy walks, reading books, physics, maths, electronics, psychology. I know nice combination :)
- No alcohol or cigarettes, I totally hate radio and ads :D

- For now Firefox, Fedora
- Learning Typescript, React
